The following is a report aimed at analyzing the evolution of solutions to the max flow problem in a network. It will clearly and thoroughly show how to improve upon the Edmonds-Karp algorithm until reaching a polynomial time solution of $O(nm)$.

In particular, we will focus on the $O(nm)$ solution for sparse graphs, Orlin's algorithm, by examining all the intermediate algorithms that led to the final solution.

The algorithms are presented in chronological order, starting with Dinic's algorithm, continuing with Goldberg-Rao, and culminating with Orlin's most recent and effective solution. However, before delving into the solutions, there is a chapter that explains some preliminary concepts of graph theory, necessary for understanding how the solutions work.
