abstract = {In this paper, we present improved polynomial time algorithms for the max flow problem defined on sparse networks with n nodes and m arcs. We show how to solve the max flow problem in O(nm + m31/16 log2 n) time. In the case that m = O(n1.06), this improves upon the best previous algorithm due to King, Rao, and Tarjan, who solved the max flow problem in O(nm logm/(n log n)n) time. This establishes that the max flow problem is solvable in O(nm) time for all values of n and m. In the case that m = O(n), we improve the running time to O(n2/ log n).},

abstract = {We introduce a new approach to the maximum flow problem. This approach is based on assigning arc lengths based on the residual flow value and the residual arc capacities. Our approach leads to an O(min(n2/3, m1/2)m log(n2/m) log U) time bound for a network with n vertices, m arcs, and integral arc capacities in the range [1, …, U]. This is a fundamental improvement over the previous time bounds. We also improve bounds for the Gomory-Hu tree problem, the parametric flow problem, and the approximate s-t  cut problem.},

It also presents the origins of the Soviet school of algorithms, which remain unknown to the Western Computer Science community, and the substantial influence of Shimon Even on the fortune of this algorithm.",
